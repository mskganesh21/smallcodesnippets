sitemap in react

3 ways

1.for static content applications
1.1use sitemap npm library

this is done in build process
generate a script to do 
using sitemaptoStream,streamToPromise

this creates a public folder during build
and then creates a sitemap.xml file

1.2 using react-router-sitemap
it is easier to do so 
Sitemap func from react-router-sitemap
.build and .save


2. using nextjs and npm sitemap
similar to procedure 1



coming to e-commerce website

1.use sitemap npm if products don't change
2.if nextjs then the approach is api based
and on each request we generate sitemap
